# Microsoft Glossary

Thanks for your interest in our work.

We are helping beginners to find the definitions of topics related to Azure, and the cloud in general. The **Microsoft Glossary** is a Dictionary, an Encyclopedia, a Wikipedia of technical words, expressions, and abbreviations. It helps visitors getting started with a new cloud-related topic by making it easy to understand the vocabulary. It also helps Microsoft documentation writers by providing a unique repository of topics that they can link to.

Each word, expression or abbreviation is illustrated by a short video explaining the concept. Items are cross-referenced, a little like Wikipedia does. In addition, we also list links to documentation and Microsoft Learn.
