## Structure of the "Azure word of the day" videos

> TODO Continue

> "Azure Word of the Day" is a series of videos featured in the Glossary to help illustrate a term. Note that these are obviously suitable for Azure-related terms only. For other areas of Microsoft, we can use a different kind of videos.

[Here is an example of a social video for Azure Word of the Day](https://aka.ms/define/app-service).

The videos all have a common structure that make them easy to recognize. These videos are suitable for social media so **they must be shorter than 2 minutes and 20 seconds**. In fact we recommend **aiming for 2 minutes only**.

Each video starts with the intro card featuring a jingle.

Then the term is shown, as well as its phonetic transcription, and the short description.

> The short description is the one you entered in the Microsoft Form when you got started. It can be edited in the synopsis
