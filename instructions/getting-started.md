# Creating content for the Glossary: Getting started

Thank you so much for contributing to the Glossary. With your help, we can grow and maintain the content to create a reference repository of words, expressions and abbreviations.

## Definitions

<a id="term"></a>

### Term

A Term is a Glossary entry. A Term can be a simple word (for example `serverless`), an expression or group of words (for example `app service`) or an abbreviation (for example `tls/ssl`). It can be a product name (for example `Azure Active Directory`) or a technological expression related to Microsoft products and services (for example `web server`).

### Page

A Term translates to a Page in the Glossary. For example the Term `app service` is explained [in this page](http://aka.ms/define/app-service).

### Keyword

A Keyword is a Term that is defined in the Glossary but **doesn't have its own page**. In the Glossary, when a Keyword is clicked, we redirect the reader to the related Page. For example [Encryption](http://aka.ms/define/encryption) is a Keyword which redirects to the Page titled `TLS/SSL`.

> When a Keyword redirects to a Page, the words `(redirected from [keyword]) are shown in the title.

### Synopsis

A Synopsis is a document where the author for a new Term defines the information that will be used to publish the Term to the Glossary, and to create the social video that accompanies it. When you [register to define a new Term](http://aka.ms/define/new), the process will create a new draft Synopsis. You can then complete the sections following the process described below in this document.

> You can see [an example of completed Synopsis here](http://aka.ms/glossary/sample/synopsis).

<a id="form"></a>

## What should you do first?

If you have not done this already, [you should submit the "New term" form](http://aka.ms/define/new).

After you submit this form, you will get an email with a link to the new Synosis. You can then fill the sections. Follow the instructions below!

## Creating the synopsis

At this point you should have received an email with instructions about the next steps. The email has a link pointing you to a new file that was created in the Microsoft Glossary GitHub repository. This is where you will spend most of this phase of the work.

> Creating the synopsis should take you about 1-2 hours.

Click on the link in the email that you receive.

> If you didn't receive an email after submitting the new term, check your junk folder. The email is titled `ACTION NEEDED: Thanks for submitting to the Microsoft Glossary`. If you still cannot find it, contact [LBugnion@microsoft.com](mailto:LBugnion@microsoft.com).

The links should look something like that:

`https://github.com/lbugnion/ms-glossary/blob/{new-term}/synopsis/{new-term}.md`

The synopsis has the following sections that you should fill before submitting it for review:

### Your information

You have probably already entered your information [when you submitted the form above](#form). We need the following:

- Your name
- Your email address
- Your Twitter username
- Your GitHub username
- A short description for the term you entered. The short description will be used later in the social videos.

### Transcript

### Structure of the "Azure word of the day" videos

> "Azure Word of the Day" is a series of videos featured in the Glossary to help illustrate a term. Note that these are obviously suitable for Azure-related topics only. For other areas of Microsoft, we can use a different kind of videos.

[Here is an example of a social video for Azure Word of the Day](http://aka.ms/define/app-service).

The videos all have a common structure that make them easy to recognize. These videos are suitable for social media so **they must be shorter than 2 minutes and 20 seconds**. In fact we recommend **aiming for 2 minutes only**.

Each video starts with the intro card featuring a jingle.

Then the term is shown, as well as its phonetic transcription, and the short description.

> The short description is the one you entered in the Microsoft Form when you got started. It can be edited in the synopsis

> For later -----------------------------
