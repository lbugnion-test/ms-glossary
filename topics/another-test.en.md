## Transcript

**This is a test term only, please ignore.**

Designers at the digital agency Boom have imagined a better way. They’ve created a free text generator that replaces lorem ipsum with useful, topical prose that you can build in list or paragraph form, and in plain text or HTML. So if you're creating a cooking site, you can generate text about hamburgers or tacos. And if you’re creating a political app, you can generate text about democracy or past presidents. It may not matter, but at the same time, if you’ve ever had to squint past the weird Latin to really focus on the layout of a design, you’ll appreciate the improved topical context.

How does the system generate all this custom content? It actually skims Wikipedia pages related to your search, copy-and-pasting information and reformatting it just for you. That means it’s not the sort of text you’d ever want to claim as your company’s own. But then again, it’s perfect for creating a layout that’s not trapped in a two-millennia-old anachronism.
